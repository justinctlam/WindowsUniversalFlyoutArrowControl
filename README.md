# WindowsUniversalFlyoutArrowControl
An example implementation of creating a flyout control with an arrow.

## Synopsis

This project shows how you can creat a flyout control that has an arrow pointing to the element that initiates the flyout.

## Motivation

There are many designs that call for a popup with an arrow indicator to present something to the user. The Universal Windows platform doesn't provide support for a flyout with an arrow so this project is one way to create this UI effect.
